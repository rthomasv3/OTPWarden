# OTPWarden

## About
OPT Warden is an in-progress idea for storing and hosting one time passwords in a more convenient way. Some password managers allow you to store OPT keys, but having a second account where these are hosted makes it a true second factor and increases security. It would also allow them to easily carry over between browsers and phones.

The plan would be to eventually have:
1. A browser extension just like a password manager to detect and store OTP keys during the setup process (read QR codes or copy raw code).
2. A mobile app.
3. A website (self-hostable or pay to host model similar to Bitwarden).
